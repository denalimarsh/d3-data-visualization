 The tree maintenance data visualized in the above geospatial map was provided by San Francisco's open data project, data.sf.gov.org. The dataset included multiple details about each incident: address, time case opened, latitude/longitude coordinates, the neighborhood, and current case status, along with several other metrics. The dataset is both extensive and ongoing - using a datastream from Socrata, the visualization will update as new tree maintenence incidents are reported and logged by data.sf.gov.org. The full dataset for this visualization can be found <a href= "https://data.sfgov.org/resource/d9d2-cuwu.json">here</a>.

This visualization is a non-proportional symbol map designed to show the current status of tree maintenence case's around San Francisco. In addition to the static street view map and the color encoded locations of maintenence incidents, there are two interactivity features which further the impact of the visualization. Each district's name and boundry will appear in a distinct black upon hovering over it, while hoving over an induvidual tree maintenance case will activate the "additional details" box, displaying case ID, address, neighborhood, the time opened, and the current status.

The focal point of this visualization is case status. The visualization's goal is to effectively communicate where tree maintenence occurs through the use of geolocated circles, placed accurately upon the district/street view maps. Through this method, the audience can more readily identify districts with a higher incident rate. In addition, the green-red color encoding of current status (open or closed) serves to quickly inform the viewer of where tree maitenence is currently ongoing.
